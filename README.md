# No thanks

No thanks is a Golang tool developed specifically to reply to recruiters with user-defined messages.

The user(you), can fill out a response that will be sent to the recruiter or person messaging you when it matches a 
keyword, that is also user-defined. 


## Installation

### Windows without Docker

In order to run the software on Windows, locally, without Docker, you will need Java, which can be found here.
I recommend using Java 17 as that version is the LTS version.

As for the rest, simply head to the release pages and download the latest version, configure your credentials and run the application.

## FAQ

#### What languages does No thanks currently support?

Currently, English is the only language supported, though there are plans to add more.

#### How can I write an automated reply?

Simply head to the the automated_replies folder and fill the text file found in there.

**Note that in order for the software to use your generated reply, the software must be run after saving the text file.**
